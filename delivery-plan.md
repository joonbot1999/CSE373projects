# Coordination

## What will the project management practices be?
Oversee the testing, make sure that deadlines are met, provide assistance in design and development, communicate often with team about development progress

## Will you have meetings? How frequently? Who plans their agendas?
We will have weekly meetings - at least once a week. This will be on Wednesdays at 10:30-11:30 am. We will be in frequent contact via discord, and will have Friday evenings available for additional meetings, if needed.  

# Development Milestones (Nov 1 - Dec 11)
A list of milestones you'll reach and deadlines for each.
Milestones should probably be features, e.g. "Favorite brands", "Organization list filterable", to allow for iterative delivery.
There should be at least one milestone per week of the development sprint, but they shouldn't be "week 1", "week 2" etc.
