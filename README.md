## Mission Statement ##
To promote community service by connecting people to opportunities. 

## Problem Statement ##
People are always seeking ways to help and get involved in order to improve the community. With so many resources and nonprofits that support different causes, it is quite difficult to find ones that volunteers are interested in and can help make the most impact with. According to nonprofithub.org, there is a huge lack of information. Regarding using such technology, there is a lot of misinformation and not really a centralized place where people can go to learn more about getting involved. As discussed in the UN Sustainable Development Goal number 17, about ​​strengthening the means of implementation of these goals, because of the pandemic, organizations are having to recruit new volunteers and find more aid in terms of finances as well as hands-on. As a result, hiring and training are increasing in demand—getting this information across various websites, which is the method currently being used, is becoming a burden and inefficient (Successful Strategies for Recruiting, Training, and Utilizing Volunteers, SAMHSA). There are current solutions for this, however, as seen through wiredimact.com, some are very specific for a certain type of volunteer or SDG organization, and others are used for a wide range of hiring. Because of this, smaller nonprofits aren’t able to get their word across and get volunteers.
